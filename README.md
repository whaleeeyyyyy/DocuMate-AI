_(Replace this with an actual logo or banner image for your project)_

## 🚀 Project Overview

DocuMate AI is an intelligent document management system designed to streamline the organization, search, and interaction with your digital documents. Leveraging modern web technologies and AI capabilities (if applicable, e.g., for search, summarization, or classification), DocuMate provides a seamless experience for handling your important files.

This project demonstrates a full-stack application development, showcasing proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies, database integration, and modern containerization practices with Docker.

## ✨ Features

- **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and responsive frontend for easy navigation and document interaction.
- **Robust Backend API:** A secure and efficient API for managing document operations (upload, retrieve, delete, search).
- **Document Upload & Storage:** Securely upload and store various document types.
- **Intelligent Search (Optional/Future):** (If you plan to add AI features) Advanced search capabilities using AI to find relevant information within documents.
- **Containerized Development:** Fully Dockerized for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with scalability in mind, separating frontend and backend concerns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework:** [e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular]
- **Build Tool:** [e.g., Vite, Webpack, Create React App]
- **Styling:** [e.g., Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, SASS]
- **Deployment:** Served via Nginx in a Docker container.

### Backend

- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Web Server:** Uvicorn
- **Dependencies:** (List key Python libraries, e.g., `pydantic`, `SQLAlchemy`, `python-multipart` for file uploads)

### Database (If applicable)

- **Type:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite]
- **ORM/ODM:** [e.g., SQLAlchemy, Pydantic-ODM]

### Infrastructure

- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Networking:** Docker Bridge Networks

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git:** For cloning the repository.
- **Docker Desktop:** Includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
  - [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DocuMate-AI.git
    cd DocuMate-AI
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create `.env` files based on the provided examples:

    - For the backend: `cp backend/.env.example backend/.env`
    - For the frontend: `cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env`

    Open these newly created `.env` files and fill in any necessary values (e.g., database connection strings, API keys). For local development, the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/.env` should typically be `http://localhost:8000` to match the Docker Compose port mapping.

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    Navigate to the root of the project directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will:

    - Build the Docker images for both your frontend and backend services.
    - Create and start the containers.
    - Set up the internal Docker network.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the containers are running, you can access the application in your web browser:
    - **Frontend:** `http://localhost:5173`
    - **Backend API (Documentation):** `http://localhost:8000/docs` (FastAPI's interactive API documentation)

### Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the running containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker-compose up`:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

🛣️ Future Enhancements

Implement user authentication and authorization.
Integrate a database for persistent document storage and user data.
Add AI-powered features like document summarization, keyword extraction, or semantic search.
Improve UI/UX with advanced filtering and sorting options.
Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
